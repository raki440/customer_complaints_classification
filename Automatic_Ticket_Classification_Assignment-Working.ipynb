advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday  upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday xxxxxxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only now chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently unfortunately this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments etc i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document this

of  on xxxxxxxx and  on xxxxxxxx the minimum payment was  the closing date was xxxxxxxx  please see attached statement  that statement  xxxxxxxx  shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of  on xxxxxxxx i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xxxxxxxx \\nhowever when i got the xxxx statement it shows that i still have a purchase balance of  i have a promotional balance xxxx  in xxxx of  in xxxx the promotional balance was   a difference of  \\n\\napparently the payment  above the minimum payment required by chase  i thought would be applied to the purchase     was applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase thank you in advance for your assistance \\n\\nrespectfully xxxx xxxx xxxx  ...     2\n",

bank on  when i noticed the charge on my account i called back on sunday  about the provisional credit for the charge and again on monday  i was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided i used my debt card on monday  then tried to use it again but it would not work i went to chase bank on xxxx xxxx xxxx in xxxx xxxx nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity i was shocked because i had not reported fraud on my account i later found out that i was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from xxxx xxxx  xxxx i later contacted xxxx xxxx  xxxx again and was told that they did see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within     days i contacted the chase disputes department again on monday xxxxxxxx  and explained thaxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx would credit my account and that i did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim the escalation manager did not care and told me that chase decision on closing my account was final i had been a customer of chase for xxxx   years my character has been challenged by the disputes agents and i consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander \\n\\ni am not seeking to keep my account open with chase but i also do not want chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily \\n\\nonce again i do not want chase to have the checking account that i had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by chase \\n\\ni did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past  ...     3\n",

chase via a secured message on  explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\ni called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\nduring this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a  fast safe and easy way to send money  but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team  ...     3\n",

about the consequences  many other people ive seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out  and even more egregiously despite chase simply sending an email doing this they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out \\n\\nthis is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that

advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday  upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday xxxxxxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only now chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently unfortunately this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments etc i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious

with the innocuous title  important information regarding changes to your chase account   they often use similar titles for ads and other communications  \\n\\nin it they force me into binding arbitration  despite that never being something i had agreed to and never being a part of any contract between me and them  \\n\\nthey do include a method to opt out but have no additional information about the consequences  many other people ive seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out  and even more egregiously despite chase simply sending an email doing this they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out \\n\\nthis is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that is clearly being used solely to dissuade people from opting out \\n\\nthis is blatant malpractice by chase  ...

of  on xxxxxxxx and  on xxxxxxxx the minimum payment was  the closing date was xxxxxxxx  please see attached statement  that statement  xxxxxxxx  shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of  on xxxxxxxx i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xxxxxxxx \\nhowever when i got the xxxx statement it shows that i still have a purchase balance of  i have a promotional balance xxxx  in xxxx of  in xxxx the promotional balance was   a difference of  \\n\\napparently the payment  above the minimum payment required by chase  i thought would be applied to the purchase     was applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase thank you in advance for your assistance \\n\\nrespectfully xxxx xxxx xxxx  ...

bank why they reported to the credit bureau that i was  days late on a payment that was already paid off when i called i got this info  they showed that on the xxxx of  i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for  later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was  days late for not paying what accrued to be  the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them i still have  in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app \\n\\nadditionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped  points when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think thats xxxx  ...

                                   on xxxx  i made a  payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on  explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\ni called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\nduring this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of

bank on  when i noticed the charge on my account i called back on sunday  about the provisional credit for the charge and again on monday  i was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided i used my debt card on monday  then tried to use it again but it would not work i went to chase bank on xxxx xxxx xxxx in xxxx xxxx nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity i was shocked because i had not reported fraud on my account i later found out that i was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from xxxx xxxx  xxxx i later contacted xxxx xxxx  xxxx again and was told that they did see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within     days i contacted the chase disputes department again on monday xxxxxxxx  and explained thaxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx would credit my account and that i did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim the escalation manager did not care and told me that chase decision on closing my account was final i had been a customer of chase for xxxx   years my character has been challenged by the disputes agents and i consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander \\n\\ni am not seeking to keep my account open with chase but i also do not want chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily \\n\\nonce again i do not want chase to have the checking account that i had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by chase \\n\\ni did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past  ...
